The following are ideas for potential semester projects. 

1. Use Chloride tributary data, and (potentially) other features (weather, depth, time of year, etc.) to do regression,
$y_i=$ Chloride levels in Reservoir; the tributaries feed into it, could get the ${\bf x}_i$ from that.
- Liberty reservoir, have observed $y_i$​'s but not for Prettyboy or Loch Raven.
2. A binary classification model that predicts low Dissolved Oxygen based on other variables (see the variables mentioned in the graphic on Dr.~Moore's presentation &ndash; page 22).
- even potentially use other variables than in the graphic (e.g., pH level);
- statistical significance tests on feature variables.
3. Land cover: currently, have amount of Impervious cover, by watershed. A classification task...
– use variables in current data to predict land cover (make a cutoff for high/low impervious cover);
  - variables: Na, Cl, conductivity, Nitrogen, Time of year, etc.
4. (Less well-formed) Compare models from times early in the data to models that are fit to data that is later. Test statistically significant differences.
