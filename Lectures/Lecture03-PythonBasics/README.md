# Files for Lecture
Slides for Lecture 03 (with two parts) and first Jupyter notebook.

The slides for class lessons are generated with [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/), using the [Beamer](https://ctan.org/pkg/beamer) documentclass. The folder 'source' contains source files for the slides `lecture03-slides.pdf` and `lecture03b-slides.pdf`.
