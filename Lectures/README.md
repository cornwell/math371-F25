# Class Slides and Jupyter notebooks
The folders here contain slides from class and in-class notebooks for group work.

The slides for class lessons are generated with [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/), using the [Beamer](https://ctan.org/pkg/beamer) documentclass. Source files are available in the 'source' subfolders.
